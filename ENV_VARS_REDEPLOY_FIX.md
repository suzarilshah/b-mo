# Environment Variables Not Accessible Fix

## Problem
Function execution failing with:
- **Error**: "Missing required environment variables: AZURE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_KEY, AZURE_EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY, NEON_DATABASE_URL"
- **Status**: All 11 environment variables are configured in Appwrite Console
- **Root Cause**: Function deployment doesn't include environment variables set after deployment

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue Chain:
1. **Environment Variables Set** - All 11 variables are configured in Appwrite Console
2. **Function Deployed** - Function was deployed BEFORE all environment variables were set
3. **Variables Not Accessible** - Deployment doesn't have the environment variables
4. **Function Fails** - Can't access environment variables at runtime

### Why This Happens:
- Appwrite Functions capture environment variables at deployment time
- If environment variables are added/updated AFTER deployment, they're not available
- Function must be redeployed to pick up new/updated environment variables

## Fix Applied

### ✅ Redeploy Function After Environment Variables Set
**Solution**: Redeploy the function so it picks up all environment variables

**Steps:**
1. Ensure all environment variables are set in Appwrite Console
2. Redeploy the function with `--activate=true`
3. Function will now have access to all environment variables

**Command:**
```bash
cd appwrite/functions/process-document
appwrite functions create-deployment \
  --function-id=process-document \
  --entrypoint=index.ts \
  --activate=true \
  --code=.
```

## Verification

After redeployment:
1. Check deployment status: `appwrite functions get --function-id=process-document`
2. Verify `latestDeploymentStatus: ready` and `live: true`
3. Test function execution - should now have access to all environment variables

## Important Notes

### When to Redeploy:
- ✅ After adding new environment variables
- ✅ After updating environment variable values
- ✅ After changing secret variables
- ✅ When function can't access environment variables

### Environment Variables Status:
All 11 variables are configured:
- ✅ APPWRITE_ENDPOINT
- ✅ APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID
- ✅ APPWRITE_API_KEY
- ✅ APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID
- ✅ AZURE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_ENDPOINT
- ✅ AZURE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_KEY
- ✅ AZURE_EMBEDDINGS_ENDPOINT
- ✅ AZURE_EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY
- ✅ AZURE_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL
- ✅ AZURE_EMBEDDINGS_DIMENSIONS
- ✅ NEON_DATABASE_URL

## Prevention

Going forward:
1. **Set all environment variables FIRST** before deploying
2. **Redeploy after adding/updating** environment variables
3. **Verify deployment** includes environment variables
4. **Test function** after redeployment to confirm variables are accessible

## Testing

After redeployment:
1. Upload a document
2. Function should now have access to all environment variables
3. Should proceed past environment variable validation
4. Should execute successfully
