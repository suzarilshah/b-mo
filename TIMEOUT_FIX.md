# Fix Summary: Document Processing Timeout Issue

## Problem
Document upload was failing with error:
- "Synchronous function execution timed out. Use asynchronous execution instead, or ensure the execution duration doesn't exceed 30 seconds."
- Error Code: 408

## Root Cause
The `process-document` Appwrite Function was timing out because:
1. **Function timeout was only 15 seconds** - too short for document processing
2. **Azure Document Intelligence polling** could take up to 30 seconds (30 attempts × 1 second)
3. **Multiple operations** (file download, OCR, embeddings, database writes) exceeded the limit

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ✅ Increased Function Timeout
- Changed from **15 seconds** to **90 seconds**
- Command: `appwrite functions update --function-id=process-document --name="Process Document" --timeout=90`

### 2. ✅ Optimized Azure Document Intelligence Polling
- **Reduced max attempts**: From 30 to 20 attempts
- **Exponential backoff**: Starts at 500ms, increases gradually (500ms → 750ms → 1000ms → 1500ms → 2000ms)
- **Faster initial checks**: Documents typically process in 5-10 seconds, so faster polling catches results sooner

### 3. ✅ Extended Client-Side Polling Timeout
- Increased from **60 seconds** to **120 seconds** (2 minutes)
- Increased poll interval from **2 seconds** to **3 seconds** (reduces API calls)

### 4. ✅ Improved Logging
- Added timing logs throughout the function (`[XXXms]` timestamps)
- Better error messages with processing time
- Easier debugging in Appwrite Console logs

### 5. ✅ Better Error Handling
- More detailed error messages
- Includes processing time in responses
- Better error extraction from Appwrite execution status

## Files Modified

1. **`appwrite/functions/process-document/index.ts`**
   - Optimized Azure polling with exponential backoff
   - Added timing logs throughout
   - Reduced max attempts from 30 to 20

2. **`src/lib/appwrite/functions.ts`**
   - Extended client polling timeout from 60s to 120s
   - Increased poll interval from 2s to 3s
   - Improved error handling and messages

## Testing

After deployment, test document upload:
1. Go to `/documents` page
2. Upload a PDF file
3. Monitor function logs in Appwrite Console
4. Should complete within 90 seconds

## Expected Processing Times

- **Small documents** (< 5 pages): 10-20 seconds
- **Medium documents** (5-10 pages): 20-40 seconds
- **Large documents** (> 10 pages): 40-70 seconds

All should complete within the 90-second function timeout.

## Monitoring

Check function logs in Appwrite Console:
- Functions → process-document → Logs
- Look for `[XXXms]` timestamps to identify bottlenecks
- Monitor for any timeout errors

## Next Steps (if issues persist)

1. **Further optimization**: Consider parallel processing or caching
2. **Increase timeout**: Can increase to 300 seconds if needed (but may require Appwrite plan upgrade)
3. **Split processing**: Move embeddings generation to a separate async function
