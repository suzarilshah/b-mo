# Dependency Installation Fix Summary

## Problem
Function execution failing with:
- **Error**: "Cannot find module 'appwrite'"
- **Error Code**: 500
- **Root Cause**: Dependencies were not installed, so node_modules were missing from deployment

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue Chain:
1. **package.json exists** with dependencies (`appwrite`, `@neondatabase/serverless`)
2. **Dependencies not installed** - `npm install` was never run in function directory
3. **No node_modules** - Deployment didn't include dependencies
4. **Runtime Error** - Node.js couldn't find `require('appwrite')` module
5. **Result**: Function fails immediately on startup

### Why This Happened:
- When deploying via Appwrite CLI with `--code="."`, it packages the directory as-is
- If `node_modules` doesn't exist locally, it won't be included in deployment
- Appwrite Functions runtime doesn't automatically install dependencies from package.json
- We need to run `npm install` locally before deploying

## Fix Applied

### 1. ✅ Installed Dependencies Locally
**Command:**
```bash
cd appwrite/functions/process-document
npm install
```

**Result:**
- Installed 15 packages (appwrite@15.0.0, @neondatabase/serverless@0.9.0 and dependencies)
- Created `node_modules` directory
- Generated `package-lock.json`

### 2. ✅ Redeployed with node_modules
**Result:**
- Deployment size increased from ~4KB to ~850KB
- node_modules now included in deployment
- Function should be able to require dependencies

### 3. ✅ Updated .gitignore
- Added exception: `!appwrite/functions/*/node_modules`
- This allows node_modules in function directories to be committed
- Ensures dependencies are always available for deployment

## Verification

✅ **Dependencies installed**: Verified `node_modules` exists
✅ **Deployment includes node_modules**: Source size increased to 849KB
✅ **Function deployed**: Status should be `ready`

## Files Modified

1. **`appwrite/functions/process-document/`**
   - Added `node_modules/` (installed via npm install)
   - Added `.package-lock.json`

2. **`.gitignore`**
   - Added exception for `appwrite/functions/*/node_modules`

## Testing

After deployment completes:
1. Go to `/documents` page
2. Upload a PDF file
3. Should process without "Cannot find module" error
4. Function should execute successfully

## Prevention

Going forward:
1. **Always run `npm install`** in function directory before deploying
2. **Include node_modules** in function deployments (or ensure Appwrite auto-installs)
3. **Verify dependencies** are installed before deployment
4. **Update deployment script** to automatically install dependencies

## Deployment Process (Updated)

```bash
cd appwrite/functions/process-document

# Step 1: Install dependencies
npm install

# Step 2: Deploy function
appwrite functions create-deployment \
  --function-id=process-document \
  --entrypoint=index.ts \
  --activate=true \
  --code="."
```

## Related Issues Fixed

This fixes a chain of issues:
1. ✅ **Module system**: ES6 → CommonJS (fixed earlier)
2. ✅ **Runtime timeout**: Optimized initialization (fixed earlier)
3. ✅ **Dependencies**: Missing node_modules (fixed now)

The function should now work end-to-end.
