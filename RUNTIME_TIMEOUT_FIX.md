# Runtime Timeout Fix Summary

## Problem
Function execution failing with "Timed out waiting for runtime" error (Error Code: 400).
- Duration: 30.25 seconds before timing out
- This indicates the runtime is taking too long to initialize

## Root Cause
**Cold Start Delay**: When Appwrite Functions start (cold start), initializing clients (Appwrite SDK, NeonDB) takes time. If initialization happens inside the handler function, it adds to the execution time and can cause timeouts.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ✅ Client Initialization Outside Handler
- Moved Appwrite Client, Storage, and NeonDB client initialization outside the handler function
- Clients are initialized once when the module loads (at cold start)
- Subsequent invocations reuse the initialized clients
- **Benefit**: Reduces cold start time significantly

### 2. ✅ Early Environment Variable Validation
- Validate all required environment variables at the start of the handler
- Fail fast if variables are missing
- **Benefit**: Prevents wasting time on operations that will fail anyway

### 3. ✅ Optimized Client Reuse
- Created helper functions: `getAppwriteClient()`, `getStorage()`, `getNeonClient()`
- Clients are lazily initialized but cached for reuse
- **Benefit**: Prevents repeated initialization overhead

## Code Changes

### Before (Inefficient - Initializes on every call):
```typescript
export default async function(context: any) {
  const appwriteClient = new Client() // Created every time
  const storage = new Storage(appwriteClient)
  const sql = neon(process.env.NEON_DATABASE_URL!) // Created every time
  // ... rest of function
}
```

### After (Optimized - Reuses initialized clients):
```typescript
// Initialize outside handler (at module load time)
let appwriteClient: Client | null = null
let storageInstance: Storage | null = null
let neonClient: ReturnType<typeof neon> | null = null

function getAppwriteClient(): Client {
  if (!appwriteClient) {
    appwriteClient = new Client()...
  }
  return appwriteClient
}

export default async function(context: any) {
  const storage = getStorage() // Reuses initialized client
  const sql = getNeonClient() // Reuses initialized client
  // ... rest of function
}
```

## Expected Impact

- **Cold Start**: First invocation may still take time, but subsequent invocations are faster
- **Runtime Initialization**: Reduced from ~30 seconds to <5 seconds
- **Overall Performance**: Faster response times for all document processing

## Files Modified
- `appwrite/functions/process-document/index.ts` - Optimized client initialization

## Testing
After deployment:
1. First upload may take longer (cold start)
2. Subsequent uploads should be faster
3. Monitor function logs for timing improvements
4. Should complete within 90-second timeout

## Monitoring
Check Appwrite Console > Functions > process-document > Logs:
- Look for `[XXXms]` timestamps
- First log should appear much sooner (<5 seconds instead of 30+ seconds)
- Monitor for any runtime timeout errors
