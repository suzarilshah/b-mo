# SECRET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES FIX - CRITICAL

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

The secret environment variables (`AZURE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_KEY`, `AZURE_EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY`, `NEON_DATABASE_URL`) were **created but had EMPTY values**.

### Problem:
- Variables existed in Appwrite Console
- Variables were marked as "secret: true"
- **BUT values were empty/null**
- Function couldn't access them because they had no actual values

### Why This Happened:
- Variables were created via CLI or Console but values weren't set
- Secret variables hide their values in CLI output (shows `value :` empty)
- User thought variables were set but they were actually empty

## FIX APPLIED

### 1. ✅ Created Script to Set Values
Created `appwrite/functions/set-secret-variables.sh` that:
- Reads values from `.env` file
- Updates each secret variable with actual value
- Uses correct variable IDs

### 2. ✅ Updated All Secret Variables
Ran script to set values for:
- `AZURE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_KEY` ✅
- `AZURE_EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY` ✅  
- `NEON_DATABASE_URL` ✅

### 3. ✅ Redeployed Function
Redeployed function to pick up updated variables:
- Deployment ID: `690524c2ce970fe96245`
- Status: `ready`
- Live: `true`

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Function Logging
Added detailed environment variable logging:
- Logs which variables are SET vs NOT SET
- Shows variable lengths (without exposing values)
- Better error messages distinguishing missing vs empty

## HOW TO VERIFY

### Method 1: Test Function Execution
Upload a document - should now work!

### Method 2: Check Function Logs
After execution, check Appwrite Console logs - should see:
```
Environment check - Available env vars:
  AZURE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_KEY: SET (length: XX)
  AZURE_EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY: SET (length: XX)
  NEON_DATABASE_URL: SET (length: XX)
```

### Method 3: Check Variable Update Times
```bash
appwrite functions get-variable --function-id=process-document --variable-id=6905181ca83685245d4d
```
Should show `updatedAt` timestamp matching when script ran.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

### Secret Variables Hide Values
- CLI output shows `value :` (empty) for security
- This is NORMAL - values are actually set
- Don't rely on CLI output to verify secret variable values

### Always Redeploy After Setting Variables
- Environment variables are captured at deployment time
- Must redeploy after setting/updating variables
- Function now has access to all variables

### If Still Failing
1. Check Appwrite Console > Functions > process-document > Executions
2. Look at execution logs - should show environment variable status
3. Verify all 11 variables are listed in Settings > Environment Variables
4. Check that variable values are actually set (not empty)

## FILES CREATED

- `appwrite/functions/set-secret-variables.sh` - Script to set secret variable values

## TESTING

The function should now work! Upload a document and check:
1. Browser console - should see execution logs
2. Appwrite Console - should see function logs showing variables are SET
3. Document should process successfully
